End to End Lane Detection using Deep Learning
An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. An autonomous car can go anywhere a traditional car goes and do everything that an experienced human driver does. Increasing safety, reducing road accidents and enhancing comfort and driving experience are the major motivations behind equipping modern cars with Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) In the past couple of decades, major car manufacturers introduce many sophisticated ADAS functions like Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Lane Keep Assist (LKA), Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) â€¦ etc. Both LDW and LKA functions are examples of how important for the car to detect and track the road lane lines or the road boundaries accurately and on time.
